Tennis Data Analysis with Jeff's data


Scenario 1 finds the ten players with the most wins and losses since 1985

break points computes percentages for the ten players with the most wins and losses for break points saved and break points converted
next steps are to find ace percentages, and see if I can perdict which player will win the match based on break point conversion and ace percentage
